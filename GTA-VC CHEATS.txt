How not to let your vehicles explode:

When you see you vehicles (cars,motorcycles and etc) pause the game 
and type aspirine.It may look wrecked but it wont explode.

Mission: Keep your friends close:
---------------------------------
Submitted by: Kala

As soon as you get control of your character stay in your office and protect 
the safe with a colt python (handgun that kills people in one shot) then when 
it tells you to kill lance just sprint up to him and chase while ignoring 
everyone else. continue chasing lance up the stairs and kill everyone in your 
way(Just before you go on the roof you may want to use cheats like restore 
health and restore armor). When you get to the roof run towards the helicopter 
pad and pick off everyone slowly while hiding behind the wall near the 
helicopter pad. When you kill lance run back down the stairs and get the large 
wide stairs in the huge hall. Then a cutscene with sonny forelli will appear 
and as soon as that is over run away from him and run back upto the rooftop 
where you killed lance, then get out your rocket launcher (use cheat if necessary, 
and remember to refresh your health and armor). With your rocket launcher stand 
on the edge of the rooftop on the tiles until you can see the !
three limosines that spawn enemies then blow those three up to make life easier. 
Then jump all the way down to driveway but make sure you re well away from the 
front stairs when you make your jump. When you hit the ground remember to kill 
anyone attacking you (refresh your health and armor with cheats if necessary). 
Then approach the from the large stairs( you should be outside now). Then fire 
at Sonny like there's now tommorrow with rockets it took me five rockets for 
me to kill him.

1].
If you want to fight ruthlessly against the police, then go to the
dock areas and get on to the first ship and try shooting the police and the
pedestrians from there. The police wont be able to shoot you from there.

2].
You can start a race in this game too. for this, you have to purchase
sunshine motors in the dockareas. The racing missions will be in the
backward garages.

EASY MONEY? PLAY DIRTY!

Submitted by: Harvey
Its not really a cheat,but its a trick. you can get 40grand per round with this. 
first you at least have 40 grands to buy the showroom near the airport, go to 
the basement, in the right room there is a map of vice city and a list of 
illegal street race. put your bet on 40k winning race. get a vehicle, any 
vehicle, even if you only find a golf cart, use it. go out the show room and 
3 rival cars already park waiting for you. dont park near them yet. go around 
them from the grass field, keep straight until you reach the cross road. go 
to the marina hotel near by, in the middle of the hotel there are bazzoka 
launcher ready to be picked. you know what to do next. go back to the cross 
road, out from your vehicle, take a few steps, watch for cops, aim, and FIRE! 2 
Bazzoka will be enough for your rivals BBQ. get to your vehicle and enjoy a very 
peacefull joyride over the Vice city and win the 40K! in the end of the trips.
 
Keep Your Friends Close (how to beat it without cheating):
----------------------------------------------------------
Although using cheats, it's relatively easy to beat any mission, it's 
a fun challenge to go through the game without cheating (or at least 
not saving when you do)
For the final mission, the best gun to use (in my opinion) is the 
Minigun, which you can buy from Phil's place for the giveaway price 
of $10,000 (but by this point you should have enough money for this 
to be no problem). Also buy extra ammo...
When the mission starts, stand at the top of the stais and shoot 
people before they even get in the front door... you shouldn't even 
get shot once. When Lance comes in, you might have to move back into 
the office, because more men will come from the sides. With the minigun, 
you dont need to chase Lance at all, just shoot at him (and hit) for like 
a second, and he'll die. Same for when Sonny comes in... I beat the 
mission like that only losing about 70 armour. It was easy.


While doing vigilance mission:
-----------------------------
Submitted by:MadMahi(Mahesh)

Type the cheat panzer and get into a tank. After pressing the 
capsLock the mission starts by showing yellow dots the outlaws 
to be eliminated at this point get down from the tank and get 
to a distance from the tank and type big bang the level will be 
completed. Again u can type panzer to get a tank and you can do 
as many level as possibel.

Hints:

Submitted by: Varun Pandey

Quick Cash:
-----------
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rise.

Free Pay N Spray:
-----------------
To do this, just put in the Health cheat before going inside the Pay N Spray 
and it will spray it for free. 

Coppers Can't Get Me Now:
-------------------------
If you are in a Coach, the cops cannot arrest you. They will simply make you 
lose control of the Coach but you will not get arrested. To gain control 
again, just get out of the Coach and get back in. 

Make Decent Money Fast:
-----------------------
This is a really good way to make a quick $1,000. As it turns out, parking is 
ridiculously expensive in Vice City. On a North and South running street in 
Downtown on the second island (south of the Hyman Condo), there is a street 
covered in parking meters (it may be a curved street, I am not sure). If you 
run into them (or maybe use a tool like the hammer or baseball bat), you 
knock about $2-400 out of them. The only problem is if you hit them too fast, 
you will wrap your car around them and they'll get stuck in the engine. 
Explosions are usually imminent. I don't think that this willful destruction 
of private property even generates a wanted level so you're basically just 
able to get decent cash with minimal effort. 

No More Wanted Level:
---------------------
To automatically have no more wanted level, just save your game. Now, load it 
again and no more wanted level. 

Get To Little Havana Early Trick Involving Any Car:
---------------------------------------------------
To do this, just put in the Cars Float On Water cheat and drive there. It's 
as easy as that. 

More Armor:
-----------
If you enter a Enforcer, you will get Body Armor.

More Health:
------------
To get more health, just enter an Ambulance and you will get more. 

More Shotgun Ammo:
------------------
To get a Chrome Shotgun and ammo, just enter a police car. 

Higher Accuracy:
----------------
To higher your accuracy, get a machine gun with lots and lots of ammo. This 
works best when you have infinite ammo from either a cheating device or 
getting 100 percent. You can either get a tank and keep shooting it and it 
will higher your accuracy over time or you can shoot a blown up car carcass. 
If you want to do this without actually having to play, just tape down the 
shoot button and go to sleep. When you wake up, you have a lot better 
accuracy. Try to do this with the M4 and in 3rd person view and not first. 

Look At All The Sea Animals:
----------------------------
I forgot who first made this strategy, but if you go waist high in the water 
along the coasts of the islands, you can crouch down in it and not drown. To 
use this, use your sniper rifle and zoom in and you can see all kinds of 
animals like sharks, turtles, jellyfish, and regular fish. 

Sparrow:
--------
Go to the roof of the building where you first started G Spotlight and there 
will be a Sparrow parked there.There is 
also one on the roof of a house near the Pay N Spray in Ocean Beach. To get 
to it, go to the Collars And Cuffs in Ocean Beach. Then, go down that alley 
where Collars And Cuffs is and there will be a parking garage on your right. 
Go to the top floor and there will be some ramps. Before jumping, look around 
and find the Sparrow and then jump to it. I'm not sure if you can reach it in 
one jump or not so you might half to jump more than 1 roof. The parking 
garage is also located near the Pay N Spray. It is white and has around 5 
stories. For the easiest way, just get to the Pay N Spray in Ocean Beach. 
Now, go to that place right by it with the parked PCJ-600 and Banshee (or 
sometimes Cheetah's or Infernus's). Now, get the PCJ-600 and back up all the 
way from the white stairs. Back up until you have crossed the street and have 
went in the alley with the gray pavement. Keep going back until you reach the 
shrubs. Now, punch the gas and go fast and hit the stairs. You need to clear 
the first building and land on the second one. It is pink. The Sparrow will 
be up there. There is also one across from the Links View Apartment. Across 
the street from it is a building with an arched entrance that you can go in. 
Go inside the arch, there will be some backyards. There should be a Sparrow 
in the first one on your right. 

Guy In Freezer:
---------------
In the opening sequence where Sonny Forelli is talking to all of his men, 
eventually a freezer will be shown in one of the scenes. If you look inside 
it, there is a man being hung by big slabs of meat in the freezer. I guess he 
got on their bad side. 


How to increase your health to 125:
-----------------------------------
Submitted by: MadMahi(Mahesh)

In the night Get a nice car and get near any prostitute (probably 
wearing black dress - 2 piece) and press horn she will come and talk 
to you. Then she will get into the car park the car near any corner 
place. After some times your money will be reducing and your health 
will increase upto 125 get her back to the road. She will get down. 
If you want the money back you can kill her and take it back. 

Constellation Rockstar:
-----------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

At night, there is a constellation of stars that makes up the Rockstar games 
symbol. It is the R with the star/* at the end. 

Someone Give Him A Hand:
------------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

First, go to the butcher shop in Little Havana. If you look in the window, 
you can see a severed arm. Ouch. 

Trophies:
---------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

If you complete any of the races at the Hyman Memorial Stadium, you will get 
a trophy according to what race you completed. They appear on top of your 
television at the Vercetti Estate. There is also a trophy for doing the 
shooting range missions at the Downtown Ammunation
 
Guy With Cement Shoes In The Middle Of The Ocean:
-------------------------------------------------
Submitted by:Varun Pandey

Get a boat and from the Leaf Links Golf Course, head towards the second 
island. Now you should see a couple of big rocks under the water. You should 
see a guy with cement shoes just in the bottom of the ocean. If you still 
can't find him, get a boat and then head to Diaz's mansion. Now facing the 
mansion (you should be facing North according to the radar), turn right and 
keep going straight and you should see him. 

Hint:

Submitted by: MadMahi(S.Mahesh)

when on a mission, if you want to kill the enemy driving in any vehicle 
(indicated with a marker in the map) just type bigbang. boom, the mission 
is completed.
Note: If you are inside any vehicle, get down from the vehicle and move 
to a distance and type bigbang. 


Money Cheat:
--------------
Submitted by: Sanju

First buy any property that has garage. Then get A police car. 
Drive the car to your garage. Start the vigilante mission. 
Get out of the car. You will be give 60 seconds to return to a 
police vehicle. Get out of the garage. When the garage door closes 
type the cheat "BIGBANG". All nearby vehicles including the criminals 
vehicle will blast. And the vehicle you stored in the garage will be 
auto repaired. Then you will get a reward of 50 bucks. Then again 
enter the car that you stored in the garage. Again get out of the car. 
Again get out of the garage. Type in "BIGBANG". Again the threat will 
be eliminated. You could do this as many times as you like.

Get Past Airport Metal Detectors:
---------------------------------
To do this, first get a car and bring it to the Escobar International 
Airport. Now, park the car where the hood is facing the entrance to the 
airport. Now, run around to the back end of the car and jump on and then walk 
up to onto the hood. Now, jump from there over the metal detector and you are 
in with all of your weapons. Now, you can cause havoc with any weapon you 
please inside the airport. 

Helicopter With Wheels:
-----------------------
If you put a helicopter in the Pay N Spray, it will come out with wheels. 

Quick Cash:
-----------
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rack 
up. 
Faster Reload:
--------------
To get faster reload abilities, complete the shooting course at the Downtown 
Ammunation with a score of 45 or higher. 

Garage Trick:
-------------
This trick lets you put more garages than the designated amount. All you have 
to do is drive a car halfway in to where the door won't close. Now all you 
have to do is drive as many vehicles as you want in until it is packed. This 
will cause the garage to eat your cars sometimes so use at own risk. 

Free Pay N Spray:
-----------------
To do this, just put in the Health cheat before going inside the Pay N Spray 
and it will spray it for free. 

Coppers Can't Get Me Now:
-------------------------
If you are in a Coach, the cops cannot arrest you. They will simply make you 
lose control of the Coach but you will not get arrested. To gain control

After you make your first jump through the office and get the first marker, 
ride off the side and go to police station and "borrow" their helicopter. 
After getting the helicopter, all you have to do is fly around and land in 
the markers. This is a much faster and easier way of tackling this mission.

To tweak your vehicle use the file handling.cfg in the game folder.
Make sure you backup it first.You can change the weight, acceleration, 
top speed, centre of gravity & many other parameters of your vehicle.
Make sure you stay in limit of the parameters.

In Checkpoint Charlie it is very difficult to complete the mission using 
the speedboat.To make it easy all you have to do is to park an Infernus 
or Cheetah in the dock near the speedboat.As soon as the countdown beguns 
step into the car & type SEAWAYS.Now you can drive the car on water and 
complete the mission.

HOW TO FIND THE BIG PHALLUS IN VICE CITY
----------------------------------------
Here's one of the coolest Easter eggs for GTA: Vice City. 

Fly toward the "V.C. Hotel" or is it "D.C. Hotel" or 
something from the direction of the river behind the "Malibu", 
or just stand a little behind the "Malibu" club as the sun sets 
and you should see it, it will appear as the lights on the building 
are switched on in the shape of a phallus with two balls on either 
side, you can watch it for a minute or so more after it has formed 
to watch it "spout" semen (as the rest of the lights go on) as the 
Rockstar owner said in one PCF magazine (which is what started me 
on my hunt to find it, as he said it was his favourite part of the 
game, but I only found it while fooling around in the game yesterday 
with a completion meter of 75%).

Once found, you'll be able to see it almost every time it's there and 
you'll ask yourself why the heck you didn't see it in the first place! 

--------------------------------
A PART OF GTA3 IN GTA VICE CITY
--------------------------------
Another cool easter egg, you can find part of the city of "GTA3" 
depending on how well you know it (if you remember those stupid 
movie ads they had up in GTA3 like "Chuck Swartz is "Half Cocked""), 
go to the movie studio and look around at the sets near where you find 
one of the only hummers in GTA:VC (others at military base and Phil's 
place), there you'll find a set resembling one of GTA3's streets in 
Staunton Island I think, near the movie cinema, complete with a "Bolt 
Burgers" outlet.

------------------------
OTHER COOL EASTER EGGS
------------------------
Also, there are several pools on the island where Diaz's mansion used to 
be, but which becomes yours eventually in the middle of the game (denoted 
on the map by a giant "V" or "D" depending on where you are in the game)
where you can see a pool shaped like a woman's "bikini top and bottom" 
from the neck down (and observe where the diving board is placed ), one 
shaped like the Rockstar logo in which you can find a flame thrower, two 
with a beach ball inside them which you can use to test the "power" or your 
various guns and which blows up and fragments in an explosion and one which 
has a turtle picture drawn at the bottom of it. 
There are other interesting ones as well, but these are my fav.

The guy in the "Ammunation" store who sells you the guns also is wearing a 
jacket which has the Rockstar logo in the top corner, check it out with a 
sniper rifle for easy viewing (esp. on higher resolutions).

I'll just add that the little signs at the airport(which look like small 
read and yellow prism shaped ramps on the ground) can be used to do several 
good flips in a car, esp. if you're in a fast car like a Hotring racer 2 
(the one with chrome bumpers) and if you come all the way from the end of 
the opposite wall.

       the east. You will acquire the 2 fastest boats.
 
Tip 2: when you have the cops on you and if you want to get rid of them simply go back 
       to a save point and save it then you will not have the cops after you

Tip 3: To help get rid of the cops, jump off any of the slow-mo movie cam jumps and if 
       you land upside down get run and hide and they will not be able to find you for quite  
       awhile.

Tip 4: To get a submarine stand by the boat house (in the harbor) face the water and do 
       the caddy cheat. A small yellow submarine will appear in the water ,it also fires missiles.

Tip 5: if u wanna win a street race 2 make a lot of money get a rocket launcher and shoot the 
       other cars while they r on the starting line. They will blow then u can drive 
       around the course and win the cash.

Tip 6: If u want to get easy cash just look for a cop chasing someone and start to punch 
       the person the cop is chasing and u will get 50 bucks each time u punch the guy try not 
       to punch the cop. Go to the mall there is alot of cops chasing people there.

Tip 7: In Vice City it seems the army trust the cops. Idiots!! Anyway to get the Rhino or 
       the Hunter out the army base without being shot at, simply make sure you are wearing
       the cop uniform! Works every time.

Tip 8: In the shooting range in the downtown ammu-nation, get a score of 40 or more to 
       have unlimited ammo on the pistol and you always have it -no matter how many times 
       you are busted or wasted.

Tip 9: Go to the Pay 'n' Spray in Ocean Beach. A block away you'll find a pink 
       apartment. Enter 3C and check out the bathroom.

Tip 10: Shoot the moon with a sniper rifle and watch it expand.

GTA Vice City Tips:

http://kofdangerous.simgames.net

Helicopters On Water:
---------------------
If you do the cars hover on water cheat, you can have your heli land in the 
water. 

More Money:
-----------
If you enter a taxi, you will automatically get money. 

Secret With Taxi:
-----------------
When doing a taxi mission (not for Kaufman Cabs), if you drop someone off 
right when the timer is at 0:00, the timer turns off and you can take as long 
as you want to drop people off at their destinations. You can do as many 
missions as you want. It's an easy way to make a lot of money if you have the 
time and patience to do it. 

Pogo The Monkey And Degenatron Arcades:
---------------------------------------
In the pizza joints and inside Kaufman Cabs, you can find these arcades but 
they are not playable. 

Australian American War:
------------------------
On the Vrock radio station, you will hear an Ammunation commercial that talks 
about the Australian-American War. If you remember correctly from Grand Theft 
Auto 3, there was a caller on Chatterbox that talks about fighting in the 
Australian-American War. 

Wow, What A Reward:
-------------------
After you complete all of the movie studio missions, a huge poster will 
appear at the Vercetti Estate of a nude Candy Suxxx and various pictures of 
her and the guy from "Martha's Mug Shot" will appear on your desk. 

Army Women:
-----------
To do this, put in the Ladies Man and Women Have Weapons cheats. Now, just 
steal a coach and let them on. Now, when you get off, you will have an army 
of women following you around. Quite funny. 

Supercop:
---------
The supercop is a cop that can bust you in just about any place! You could 
be going as fast as you can on say a PCJ-600, with no cop in sight (with a 
wanted level of course)m and you will suddenly get knocked off and busted. 
Or you can get a wanted level of some sort, 3 or more, and get in a Helicopter 
and rise as high as you can, and begin slowly moving forward to stay up 
there, but suddenly the door flies open and you come dropping out with a 
cop standing right next to you, gun down right at you and your Helicopter 
lying on top of you, busted. There is no way to kill him at all. The supercop 
also has super human speed. He runs faster than the PCJ-600 at top speed. 
The supercop is a menace to criminals worldwide! We must find a way to stop 
him! 


Hint:
-----
Submitted by: Aidan

1.To get big bucks for a simple motorbike trick, take a PCJ-600 and rid on the 
diagonal runway of the airport, from the end nearest the ocean, to the end near 
civilization, in order to gather good speed. Now Ramp up the steepest of the two 
ramps, and when in the air, press the 'wheelie' key until the bike is vertical, 
then press the 'stoppie' key to bring the front wheel down. do this as many times 
as possible while you are in the air, because every time the bike 'stands' vertical, 
it is recorded as a flip, and the more flips you have in a trick, the better the 
trick is and the more cash you get for it. Try this on any steep ramps.

2.Also, Try ramping on the 'ramp'-signs, but come in at an angle, and push the 
'wheelie' button. This makes for a really awesome jump rotation. I've gotten over 
2000 degrees.

In the game many times you don't know where to go for the next mission. 
So, easy way is to caught by police by increasing wanted level. You can

These lines are in the file handling.cfg see for car you want to tweak and edit it

now in data(line 37 in handling.cfg)
it is (N) TransmissionData.fMaxVelocity [5.0 to 150.0]
so in chart go to N(search in line 81) and in police ( line 106)edit value to say 1 the line 
(106) will look like this
POLICE 1600.0 2.1 5.0 1.6 0.0 0.0 0.15 75 1.05 0.78 0.52 5 1.0 28.0 4 P 11.1 0.53 0 35.0 2.

simillarly you can edit weapon.dat and change damage(G) to zero so that you wont die due 
to any gun

Hint:
-----
you can still kill others with a gun with zero damage just shoot their head or shoulder 
and they cant kill you!
but still keep a gun with some damage you need to shoot vehicles

1.How to get back on land.
When you are on a boat far from the land you can get to the land quickly by 
doing this trick. First of all be full health and armor. (Use cheats if you 
want.) You must be standing in the boat and not driving it. Now just type 
BIGBANG. The boat will burn and you will be standing on it .In about 10 
seconds you will find yourself in the nearest land area. Check this out.
Just mail me if you need more guidance.

2.How to find other thieves in VICE CITY
The most thief prone area is around north point mall. Between north point 
mall and pay n spray if you park a good car in the night you will soon find 
many people fighting for the car. To see this the best place there is a 
parabolic curve in this area towards the sea. Look in the game map in the 
main menu to find it. Now get a good car like Cheetah or Phoenix and get 
there in the night. Park it anywhere on the roadside. Just move some 50 
metres and you will see some guy in red or black shirt taking your car. 
If you want you can get back your car by throwing him out. After you get 
your car and get the non-driver side towards the thief he will enter the 
car and you will be forced to get out. If you accelerate before he completely 
gets in, you can travel with him. Some times he may do the driving and push 
you to the back seat. Check This Out. Just mail me if you need more help. 


How to Do a Upside Down Stunt:

and high jump. After you get to a corner and accelerate towards the high 
hump like structure start doing Wheelie using num 6 button. When you are 
in the sky press the wheelie button continuosly. You will surely do an 
upside down stunt. But very few times the reward will be given for it.

2.The invisible wall in the sea

Just go tho the horizon using a boat and far from Vice City. After some 
time you will find yourself being hit by something whuich rotates your 
boat by 180 degrees. If you again turn and go you will again be hit.

3.How to kill people in a large way

First of all burn a vehicle using a cheat or by firing. Soon people will 
gater around the burned vehicle. Now again type BIGBANG and many will die 
and much more will come near. By doing this you can kill a large number

Vehicle Repair
Tired of looking for payýn spray? Well now you don't have to look for it. 
Buy a house with a garage and if your car is damaged you can put it in the
garage and make the garage close. Then open it up and walla, your car is 
NOT damaged or broken. Also works on motorcycles. (does not work with the 
Rhino The Tank) And what i like most about it you can blow the car into 
pieces in your garage and open it up again and it's like new! (This is 
the best part) It's FREE! 

2] Tip For 'Waste the Wife' Mission
Here's just a little tip if you're having problems with the 'waste the 
wife' mission (i.e your car blows up before hers does) Answer the phone, 
listen to the call and get into the position either in a car or on a 
motorbike (motorbikes are easier) Watch the wife get in the car and 
drive off- chase her. She'll stop at some traffic lights, get close and 
jump off the bike (or out of the car) and quickly type in 'bigbang' her 
car and any other vehicle close by with explode. Instant mission success. 
Note: if you're in a car or on a bike when you type in the bigbang cheat 
then your car/bike will explode too, so it's best to get up close (without 
hitting her car otherwise she'll panic and flee) then jump out before 
typing the cheat. You'll still complete the mission, but you'll get wasted 
at the same time.) 

3]Check out at the check in
For this mission, you need to go to the airport, kill some guy, and drive 
through a gauntlet of cops, cars, and machine guns. It is usually impossible,
but there are a few alternatives. You can take the chopper from your mansion 
to the airport, fly to the airport, and then fly to the Amu-Nation. 
The other way is to run. Once you get the briefcase, go out of the airport 
and turn right on the road. Take the next left. After the turn, get on the 
next road and jump the rail. From there you are clear to run behind the 
junkyard and Phills place and come out from behind the Pizza place.

4]Secret Room
Go to the rooftop of the VCN building (on the second island) and walk to 
the closest wall facing the helipad (head West). There are a lot of windows
on the wall but one leads to a secret room. It is the easiest one to reach 
but if you have trouble finding it look out for any little white dots on 
the wall, just jump through it and you appear in a small room with a 
chocolate Easter egg saying happy Easter.

Put the flying car cheat in(comeflywithme)THIS CHEAT CAN GET YOU STUCK AT 99%! 
Best to use it after you beat the game.Now get a tank(panzer).Turn the turret 
180 degres. FIRE FIRE FIRE. while hitting th gas DO NOT STOP SHOOTING OR YOU 
WILL FALL! Fly higher than the airoplanes do(not the little red one).go over 
the stadium and go streight down( it took me a while to get there because 
I kept on missing) If you have 2 stars this is eazier because you can try 
to land right beside the "floating" cop car.I am not shure what it is I 
think it is the hot ring track suspended in the air with no senery.

Publicity Tour mission: Easy completion: 
----------------------------------------
To pass this mission easily, keep tapping [F1] repeatedly for the replay effect to hear 
all of the dialogue without having to worry about the detonation meter. Note: The most

enabling the booooooring code, if desired.

that a civilian is driving but it takes longer. Get full health and armor. Get directly 
behind the convoy and aim for one of the lines of soldiers. Run over one line of them 
then drive for awhile and get out. Turn around and blow them all the soldiers and vehicles
with the gun. There is one soldier on top of the tank. When you kill him you can get in 
the tank. Watch your health meter. When it gets below 50, pause game play and get full 
health and armor again. Take the tank and drive it into the garage. 

Prostitute on bike:

Get a motorcycle (PCJ) then look for a prostitute. When you find her, pause game play

It was a fun for me to clear it 100%.I wish that all can do this.
Here is a hint for all to get some quick cash. 
To get some quick cash, go get a gun with auto targeting. I suggest getting a 
Tec9, Uzi, Ingram Mac 10, or MP5 for this part since you can run with those 
weapons. Now that you have it, go to North Point Mall. When you get there, go 
to the Tool Shop. Once there, rob it. Then when you have your wanted level, 
run to The Gash and change costumes. Then, rob The Gash and run to the tool 
shop and change clothes. Now, just repeat the process and the money will rise.
